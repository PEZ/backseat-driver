## Joyride

Joyride could support this script better with:

* API for getting global Joyride config path
* API for getting workspace Joyride path
* Bug with not newline added for `println`

## Calva

Calva could support this script better with:

* REPL utilities API, source, doc, signatures, more?

Given the nature of this project, it might also include custom REPL interactions, intelligent navigation, code analysis, and leveraging the AI model for context-aware assistance.
